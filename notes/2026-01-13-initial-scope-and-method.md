## Purpose

This research note records the initial scope and methodological approach for ongoing public-interest analysis concerning civil–military governance and administrative decision-making as they affect civilian status and rights.

The purpose of this note is not to advance conclusions, but to establish clarity of focus, boundaries, and analytical method at the outset of the work.

## Scope

Current inquiry is limited to the following areas:

- Identification of statutory authority relied upon by public bodies in matters engaging civilian status
- Examination of procedural decision-making frameworks applied in civil–military interface contexts
- Review of information-handling, record-keeping, and communication practices relevant to civilian administrative law
- Assessment of alignment between stated authority and applied practice, based on documentary sources

This scope may be refined or expanded as additional material is examined.

## Method

The research approach is documentary and procedural in nature, and includes:

- Review of primary legislation and delegated instruments
- Examination of publicly available policy documents and guidance
- Analysis of formal correspondence and administrative responses
- Cross-referencing of stated authority against applicable legal frameworks

No assumptions are made beyond what can be supported by documentary reference.
